  Shopping made simple
</p>
</p>

## What can Macys express do?

**Helps you find and buy things you like**

This app was created at SF Hacks 2019. We wanted to make the shopping experience simple and familiar. Something that is similar to your favorite apps like Tinder and Pinterest. We tailored the app to Macy's and dynamically load items from their [API](http://developer.macys.com/page). The app could track a user's shopping experience and next time offer you things you liked most.

- Users can **swipe** through crystal clear pictures
- **Save** liked items on their favorite list
- **Get referred** to Macy's online shop
- **Order Lyft**, to the nearest Macy's store
