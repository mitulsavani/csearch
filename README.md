  Shopping is an experience; made it simple and easy to use!

## What can ma express do?

**A personalized product that helps you find and buy clothings based on your preferences**

This app was created at [SF Hacks 2019](https://sfhacks2020.com/). We wanted to make the shopping experience simple and familiar. Something that is similar to your favorite apps like Tinder and Pinterest. We tailored the app to Macy's and dynamically load items from their [API](http://developer.macys.com/page). The app can track user's shopping experience and offers you the items you liked most on next iteration.

- Users can **swipe** through crystal clear pictures
- **Save** liked items on their favorite list
- **Get referred** to Macy's online shop
- **Orders Lyft ride**, to the nearest Macy's store to buy the item you selected
